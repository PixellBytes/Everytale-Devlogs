            Howdy! My name is <span style="color: pink;">PixellBytes</span> and welcome to the
            <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span> Devlog! This site is essentially a formal blog dedicated
            to the development of my online Undertale fangame: <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span>.
            If you go to the bottom of the page, you'll
            find all of the logs in one place, ordered from newest to oldest. If you're looking for a way to
            follow the project, the intended dedicated places to follow the project are not set up quite yet
            (such as the Discord or the GameJolt page). In the meantime however, you can follow me on Reddit
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PixellBytes">here</a> and on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/PixellBytes">here</a>. I'm not super into social media, so if you
            follow me in these places you can expect 90% of the content to be about either this project or other
            game development stuff!
        </p>

            To clarify in case you're not already familiar: <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span> is an
            online multiplayer Undertale fangame that combines social game elements (i.e. VRChat) with
            Undertale style turn-based combat for PvE and PvP. Players can hang out, role-play, chat, and
            battle in an Undertale/Deltarune style world, together! The game features built-in mod tools so
            players can import/create their own custom characters to play and fight as, all completely
            cross-platform.

        <p>
            Whilst I am incredibly proud of the progress that has been made on the site thus far, its
            existence was actually a rather last minute idea. The site as you are seeing it now
            represents only three days of work. All of this is to say, <i>it is by no means finished yet!</i>
            Expect aspects of the site to grow and evolve over time as I gain more time to work on it and new
            places to follow the project emerge. Also, I am not only incredibly open to feedback, but actively
            seeking it. If there's something about the Devlog you would like to communicate to me, whether it's
            a technical problem with the site such as content not showing up correctly, or just a suggestion of
            something to add, message me or reply to a post on my Reddit or Twitter using the pages linked in
            the [WELCOME] section. Any and all feedback is appreciated! Although do be mindful of the fact that
            I work on this project in my freetime, and I don't want to get too crazy with the site as I'd rather
            spend most of that time working on the game itself.

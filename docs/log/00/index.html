        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            Happy 7th Undertale anniversary everyone, and welcome to the first ever Devlog for <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span>! (If you don't know what that is, the section after this one will get you caught up to speed.) Before I start the log, I figured considering the occasion I should put out my thoughts on how far the series has come at this point. Then again, it's difficult to say something about Undertale that hasn't already been said. As more years pass, it not only becomes more clear just how impactful this series was, but even more suprisingly, how impactful it still <i>is</i>. Undertale/Deltarune's ability to stay in public relevance is unlike any other game I've ever seen, and I think that speaks to just how much these games touch the people who play them.
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            I know personally that Toby Fox's work has influenced me more, and been a bigger source of inspiration than any other piece of media. I know that's a bit easy to say when I'm literally making a fangame, but even prior to <span style="color: red;">Everytale's</span> conception, so much of my personal creative work is the result of the way I felt after playing these games. I don't think Undertale or Deltarune are neccesarily the best games I've ever played, but they're my personal favorites for how they made me feel while playing and how that feeling stuck with me even long after I put them down. Speaking on the "after I put them down" part, it's also hard to process how long this series has been a part of my life. I was a kid when Undertale originally released. I even have nostaligc memories of listening to the soundtrack in my bed, not wanting to sleep because I had school the next day. Now, seven years later, its an even bigger part of my life, and I anticipate its going to stay that way for years to come.
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            To Toby Fox, Tem, and everyone else who has contributed to making Undertale and Deltarune, thank you.
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            Oh, also, speaking of anniversaries...
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            It conincidentally happens to be <span style="color: red;">Everytale's</span> one month anniversary as well! (Quite the timing, right?) More specifically, it's been exactly one month since I posted the first version of the game design document to Reddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/comments/wqwqbf/howdy_i_made_a_game_design_document_for_an_online/">r/Undertale</a> - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/wqwtgy/howdy_i_made_a_game_design_document_for_an_online/">r/Deltarune</a>). When I initially made that document, I honestly wasn't fully secure in how I felt about the project. I knew it was something I wanted to make, but I was unsure if it was worth putting in the time and effort required to bring it to completion. I decided I would create <span style="color: red;">Everytale's</span> game design document as an excersice in game development, and then post the finished document to the Undertale and Deltarune subreddits where I would maybe get a double digit number of likes if I was lucky, and I would make my decision based on the reception it got.
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            <i>To say I was overwhelmed by the response to those posts would be an understatement.</i> To everyone who engaged with them, from the bottom of my heart...
        </p>
        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            <b>Thank you all so so SO much!!!</b> I never could have anticipated how those posts were going to blow up the way they did. The amount of likes, the great feedback, all the kind words, it was all so much! I'm even still getting occasional rewards on those posts despite the fact that they are a month old, including today. I cannot fully emphasize how much it meant to me seeing the number of who were as excited about the concept as I was. The reception the game design document got took <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span> from a game I felt like I <i>wanted</i> to make, to a game I feel like I <i>need</i> to make. There's no question about it, this is me committing. While I can't promise you'll have a version in your hands soon, I'm in this for the long haul, and I want to take you all on this journey with me. So let me catch you up on everything I've been doing since my last posts!
        </p>

            If you've read up to this point and aren't quite sure what <span style="color: red;">"Everytale"</span> is, allow me to clarify. <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span> is an online Undertale fangame I'm currently developing. The game combines social game elements (i.e. VRChat) with Undertale style turn-based combat for PvE and PvP. Players can hang out, role-play, chat, and battle in an Undertale/Deltarune style world, together! The game will also feature built-in mod tools so players can import/create their own custom characters to play and fight as, all completely cross-platform. If you want more details on the game, you can read the game design document <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5m84AWI64ZUALLqnHoz54DZHVn5b3pW/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

            So, what's been going on with the project since I made those first posts a month ago? Originally, even after I decided I was going to commit to this project, I actually didn't plan to do much. Classes were close to starting back up again at that point, and not wanting to overwhelm myself, I decided I wouldn't work on the project for a few weeks so I could get into the groove of things in my personal life. Then, after those few weeks, I would get the project files set up and ready to develop with. I would follow through... <i>on the second part of this plan.</i> As for the "not working on it for a few weeks" part? Turns out when it comes to game development stuff I can't help myself. I ended up creating prototypes for multiple systems that will be in <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span> to help myself decide how I should implement them in the real project. I named the <span style="color: #488DC1;">Godot</span> project "Dynamic Resources Test" as it was originally meant to only test <span style="color: #488DC1;">Godot's</span> resource system, which acts as the foundation for modding capibilities within <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span>. Howver, after I successfully prototyped that system, I qucikly found myself wanting to prototype other features as well, and the project quickly grew well past its original scope. This has given me a variety of in-engine previews to show you!
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            The rest of this devlog is divided into three main sections. [<u>THE FINAL PROTOTYPE</u>], which focuses on the "Dynamic Resources Test" project and the various features prototyped within; [<u>PRODUCTION</u>], which focuses on the state of the main project as it exists now and the transition from pre-production to pre-alpha; and [<u>GOING FORWARD</u>] which focuses on plans for <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span> in the future and how devlogs will be handled.
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            Let's begin.
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br><br><br></div>

        <img src="assets/GONER-Frisk.gif" class="Sprite">
        <center class="BlogSubtitle">[<u>THE FINAL PROTOTYPE</u>]</center>
        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            I am reffering to the previously mentioned "Dynamic Resources Test" as "the final prototype" because I will not be making any more prototype projects at this point. The game is now entering pre-alpha, meaning work on the actual project has begun (elaborated on more in [<u>PRODUCTION</u>]). All programming I'll do from this point forward will be coding the version of the game you will eventually get to play. In the meantime, everything I've shown off for <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span> up to this point has been theoretical, so why don't we change that! I believe showing off these prototyped systems are a good way to show my intentions for the final product, even if they're neccesarily scrappy.
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            <b>Please keep in mind that everything you're about to see are prototypes.</b> The purpose of prototypes, in my mind, is to rapidly test the implementation of systems before adding said systems to the real project. This allows me to find any potential problems with my implementation early on and avoid technical debt. <b>Everything shown in this section is purposefully basic, unfinished, unpolished, and lacking in UI. These prototypes are not meant to represent the quality of the final game, which will be far cleaner and far more polished.</b>
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            Without further ado...
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <img src="assets/prototype_in_editor.png" class="MajorMedia">

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            Here's how the prototypes are organized in-editor! There are a variety of points of interests here, but the main thing I would like to point your attention towards is panel on the right side of the screen. There, you can see the player object has a variable called "costumes," which holds an array of costume resources. Every costume resource holds:
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <ul>
            <li>A spriteframes object that holds the image data that gets used in animations.</li>
            <li>The frame change delay, which effectively controls how quick the costume's walk animations are.</li>
            <li>The walking animations frame arrays, which tells Godot how long each walk cycle should be and which sprites from the spriteframes object should called, and at what time.</li>
            <li>The sprite offset, which determines how far the sprite object should be from the actual center of the player object.</li>
            <li>A variety variables that control the collision capsule.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            The point of all this? Those of you who have read the game design document will remeber the costume system, where the idea is that a single "character" can have multiple "costumes" that they can switch between on the fly. I have these settings set up in the editor as this is a prototype, so spending time designing UI would be a waste, but in the playable version of <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span> these will be some of the parameters players will use to create custom characters in game.
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            But enough about the editor. What about in-game?
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <video muted loop controls src="assets/CostumeSwitchingCompressed.mp4" class="MajorMedia"></video>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            <i>Bam!</i> As you can see, the player in this case is switching between a variety of costumes on the fly. Costumes can even be changed whilst moving, and everything still works!
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            It should be noted that this is technically an improper use of the costume system. In the real game, the costumes array is intended to be held within a "character" resource (which it is not here), and each costume is supposed to relate to the character. For example, the character resource "Ralsei" might have three costumes: one with his hat on, one with it off, and one from when he wears a suit in Deltarune Chapter 2. The reason I'm choosing to show it off like this with completely unrelated characters is because I want to emphasize how dynamic this system is intended to be. Each of the three costumes shown off have completely different sprites, frame change delays, collision capsule sizes, etc. Costumes can be completely different from each other, <i>and they will still work.</i> This will be huge for player expression, and allow people to create some incredibly creative and dynamic characters.
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            Speaking of things that are dynamic, did you notice the video's aspect ratio? <i>It's not in 4:3.</i>
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <img src="assets/4-3aspect.png" class="MajorMedia">
        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <img src="assets/16-9aspect.png" class="MajorMedia">
        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <img src="assets/ULTRAWIDEaspect.png" class="MajorMedia">

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            Something I never really liked in Undertale, and equally disliked that fangames followed suit with, is that they're in 4:3. This doesn't take full advantage of the screen space and creates two ugly black bars on each side of your screen. Some fanagmes try to remedy this by having some nice art in place of where the black bars would normally be, but that only solves the second problem. Because <span style="color: #488DC1;">Godot</span> has fantastic UI tools, I've decided <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span> will be designed with dynamic aspect ratio support. This means the base aspect ratio is 4:3, but if the window is resized to be an aspect ratio wider than that, the game will keep the same height and increase the number of pixels visible to the left and right. This means that <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span> will be able to fill almost any screen size, which will be especially important for making the mobile version feel good to play. Most critically, however, is that the extra screen space is a great place for the chat to sit!
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <video muted loop controls src="assets/PullUpChatCompressed.mp4" class="MajorMedia"></video>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            And with that, you've seen the majority of what I prototyped before I began working on the real deal! Before we talk about the state of the main project, there is one last thing I'd like to show you. I'm putting this at the end because I don't really know how to transition into this, as it's not that interesting and disconnected from everything else. However, I did put a considerable amount of time into it, so I think you should see anyway.
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <video muted loop controls src="assets/BoxTestCompressed.mp4" class="MajorMedia"></video>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            While for the most part I knew how I was going to design <span style="color: red;">Everytale's</span> battle system, I wasn't sure how to make the box the player dodges in dynamic. I wanted to make it so that attacks could move and rotate the box, as I thought that would open up a lot of interesting bullet-hell gameplay oppritunities. I spent a day figuring it out, and the above is the result!
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br><br><br></div>

        <img src="assets/MettatonSuitCackling.gif" class="Sprite">
        <center class="BlogSubtitle">[<u>PRODUCTION</u>]</center>
        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            After I was satisfied with all the prototypes I had created, and as I began to notice it was now approaching one month since I posted the game design document, I decided it was finally time to get the real project set up in <span style="color: #488DC1;">Godot</span>, and set up the repository in GitHub. It might sound silly to dedicate a section to something like this, but it really is both a big step and something I felt I needed to be careful about. It's a big step because setting all this up marks the beginning of a new phase of production, and I needed to be careful because the way I structure the project early on sets precedent for the rest of the game's development, so it's important that said precedent is a healthy one.
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            When I set up the project, one of the most critical decisions I had to make was how I was going to structure the file system. Keeping files organized matters in a project like this due to the sheer number of files that will need to be stored. In Dynamic Resources Test, along with every other prototype that came before it, I could reasonably get away with storing files willy-nilly because they were all so small I knew I wouldn't have to worry about finding files later. <i>This is not true for <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span>.</i> But I don't have much experience working with large codebases, so I knew I would need to put extra effort into ensuring the file system stayed navigatable even at a large scale. In the end I would design it something like this:
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <img src="assets/FileSystemStructure.png" class="Sprite">

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            Below the root there are three main folders:
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <ul>
            <li>Assets, which holds art, sound effects, music, fonts, etc.</li>
            <li>Objects, which holds scene files and script files.</li>
            <li>Resources (currently absent), which will hold both <span style="color: #488DC1;">Godot</span> and custom resource files.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            Then, each child folder groups categories of files together, getting more specific the further you go down. Organizing the file system this way can make creating new files a pain sometimes, but ultimately avoids technical debt and significantly improves project management.
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            You might notice the term "pre-alpha" in the screenshot above. I'm happy to announce that <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span> is now offically in the pre-alpha stage of development! Before, the game was in a combination of the "planning" and "pre-production" stages of development (both simultaneously because I'm only one person). Now that the game is being built, we are in the pre-alpha stage of production. The term "pre-alpha" has a fairly loose definition, and is usually used to describe the stage between the pre-production stage and the alpha stage. A game goes into alpha when it becomes feature complete, but isn't content complete yet. Since we just got started, we are a very long way from the alpha stage. You can expect <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span> to be in pre-alpha for most of its development life. 
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            You are now fully caught up on where we <i>are.</i>
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            The only question left is <i>where do we go from here?</i>
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            The first order of business for <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span> in terms of development will be building the "cosmetic" system (which I'm thinking of renaming to the "character" system) from the game design document. This will be the modded part of the game and the bedrock on which everything else stands on. As such, I am expecting it will be one of (if not the longest) feature implementations in the entire process. Ideally I think it should take me about a month and a half to finish, but I anticipate it could take up to three months of development due to how broad and complex this feature is and how many considerations need to be made regarding every aspect of the game's design.
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            What about devlogs like this one? When can you expect more? That question is a bit more complicated... In the past I've said I would release devlogs in line with major features being finished. But I'm not sure how I feel about that idea anymore due to the large variation in the amount of time it takes to implement various features. As I recently stated, the "cosmetic" system could take up to <i>months</i> to finish and I don't want to leave you all hanging that long, especially with the knowledge of how many people actively follow the project. Plus, that can go the other direction too: if multiple major features are implemented quickly, I don't want to rapidly put out devlogs. So I've decided on a compromise that I think allows me to reasonably pace myself while still keeping the community happy:
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            <b>You can safely expect devlogs to release at a rate of about one per month.</b> That doesn't mean they'll come out the same day every month, it's not a strict guideline. But as a rough estimate, you can hold that expectation going forwards.
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            One more thing about the devlogs, and that is their length. I'm going to be honest here... writing this was absolutely brutal. I recognize part of that has to do with building an entire site to hold these logs, but even writing this post took significantly longer than I expected. It's the first time I've ever felt stressed working on this project. I only have my limited free time to work on this, and time I spend writing devlogs is time I'm not spending developing the game. So in the future you should expect devlogs to be shorter. Don't worry though, as they'll also be far more focused on the technical side of things than this one was, and I'll be sure to bring new gameplay and engine snippets with me to every single post!
        </p>

        <div class="BigNewline"><br></div>
        <p>
            Before I close this out, there's a question I'm sure a lot of you have been wondering that I want to put to rest. When will you actually get to play <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span>? I have nothing to say on the topic of a potential release date -- the game is simply too early in development for me to speak on that. But I would like to make a big commitment here. <b>I want <span style="color: red;">Everytale</span> to, at minimum, have a publicly playable alpha build by a year from posting this devlog.</b> I see how many people are as passionate about this concept as I am, so I would like to get a version you can play out as soon as possible! It will be a lot of work to get there, but I firmly believe it's achievable and that the effort will prove worth it.

            Thank you for reading the whole way through! This took much longer to write than I thought it would, so the fact that you took the time to read the whole thing means a lot. That's all the updates for now, but I'll be back with more in about a month!
